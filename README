This project has been developed on OSX, using JDK v1.7

To compile the project and start the server, invoke 'deploy-server.sh'.

This will clean any existing .class files, recompile both the client and server from source,
copy the new binaries into the 'server' subdirectory, and run a server instance there.
At this point, the client can be invoked as `java trustcloud <options>`.

The server defaults to port 19999. Another port can be specified on the command line (directly to Server.class).

A number of non-code files are included here for testing. Private key files (.jkey) are also included here so vouching can be performed by the client. They do not belong on the server server.
The server requires the key server_key.p12 to be present, while the client requires trustcloud_ca_cert.crt.

Both the client and the server components expect filenames to be relative to their working directory.

Acceptable invocations of the client:
java trustcloud -h localhost:19999 -l
java trustcloud -h localhost:19999 -a kittens.jpg
java trustcloud -h localhost:19999 -u john.crt
java trustcloud -h localhost:19999 -f kittens2.jpg -c 2
java trustcloud -h localhost:19999 -v kittens.jpg alice
java trustcloud -h localhost:19999 -v bob.crt alice

Note that vouching for a `.crt` file represents vouching for the identity associated with the certificate. A ring of trust is constructed by performing this vouching.
If a file is vouched-for with a certificate not present on the server, the vouching will be stored but will be
disregarded as invalid until the associated certificate is uploaded.

the -v option takes two arguments.
1: the name of the file to be vouched for (assumed to be in the current working directy of the client) (with file extension)
2: the NAME of the public/private key, no extension at all. (private key files and certificates are expecting to have matching names.)
